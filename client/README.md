Basic UI5 development skeleton
==============================

This is a very simple skeleton for developing with UI5

The idea behind this is to have a quick bootstrap for all important files to test and prototype UI5 applications.

It comes with these features already built in:
*   html file with bootstrap and shell/Component initialization
*   root view with sap.m.App control plus controller
*   manifest.json with basic routing (empty pattern for Home.view.xml) and i18n initialization
*   Component.js with view model initialization

Some things you might want to do after forking this:
*   Adapt the application namespace to your needs (set to ui5.dev per default)
*   Adapt minUI5 version in the manifest to your target UI5 version

Happy Development!
